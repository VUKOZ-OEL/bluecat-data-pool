# Censuses


- Census data from 1975, 1997, 2008 (DBH of 100 mm+); 2012, 2017, 2022 (alive stem DBH of 10 mm+, dead stems DBH of 10 mm+).
- Data from 2012 and later follow ForestGEO census protocol.
- Stored as GIS layers (ESRI shapefiles)
- Point and line representation of live and dead stems (pieces of stems)
- Attributes: TreeID, StemID, PieceID, Species, Status, Decomposition, DBH_mm, Height_m, Diameter1 (LineStart), Diameter2 (LineEnd)


# Juveniles

- Spatial distribution, survival and height of woody plant individuals ≥10 cm tall and ≤1 cm DBH
- One square seedling plot (5 m	× 5 m) with the first census in 2016
- Height measured yearly, survival and recruitment (ingrowth of new seedlings) identified and mapped in the first re-census (2017) and following years (2018–2020)
- Life (0 = dead, 1 = surviving), height (continuous in cm)
- "BK" - European beech (_Fagus sylvatica_) was the only species present on the plot
