## VEGETATION

### 2023

Phytosociological relevés on 20 reseach plots designated in 2023 for the study of the biodiversity of the Žofín old growth forest. 
Plots are circular with radius 12,6m, area 500m2.
Data was collected during July 2023. 
The orientation of the plots to cardinal directions, slope gradient and elevation were recorded.
Total vascular plant cover, woody plant cover and herbaceous cover as well as tree layers cover were expressed as percentages based on an ocular estimate.
Cover of shrub layers and herbaceous understory species was assessed using the Brown-Blanquet mixed scale of abundance and dominance. <br>

Study of the dynamics of the development of the Žofín old growth forest
It began in 1974 with the first tree census (Ing E. Průša) and the establishment of a network of permanent research plots where phytosociological records were made (Ing J. Vokoun).
These surveys were repeated by members of the Blue Cat team in 1997, 2008 and 2023.
The network includes 44 permanent research plots.
Plots are circular with radius 12,6m, area 500m2.
Total vascular plant cover, woody plant cover and herbaceous cover as well as tree layers cover were expressed as percentages based on an ocular estimate.
Cover of shrub layers and herbaceous understory species was assessed using the Brown-Blanquet mixed scale of abundance and dominance. <br>

## INSECTS

### 2023

Saproxylic beetle communities were studied using window traps (also known as flight interception traps) according to the methodology for AOPK (Schlaghamerský 2004). These consisted of three sheets of transparent plexiglas, assembled in a cross, 50 cm high, one 25 cm wide and two 12.5 cm wide. The trap was covered on top with a plastic roof, the lower part consisted of a funnel and a collection container (Fig. 1). The traps were hung on bamboo poles approximately 1.5 m above the ground and placed one on each of the 20 study plots. The traps were installed on the site on 19 May, and sampling took place at approximately monthly intervals. During the last visit (26 September), all traps were removed from the site. A saturated salt solution was used as a preservative, which does not repel insects, but does not attract them from a wide area either (Siitonen 1994). To remove surface tension, a drop of detergent was added to the preservation solution. In the laboratory, the collected material was sorted and transferred to 70% alcohol. All captured saproxylic beetles (except for the families Staphylinidae and Leiodidae, which are difficult to determine) were identified to the species level and stored in the Moravian Museum in Brno. <br>

### 2015

In 2015 a survey of Click beetles (Elateridae) was done using 12 flight interception traps. In total 94 individuals of 8 species were recorded (Tab. 1). Four species are tied to dead wood in their development. Three saproxylic species were present in at least six of the 12 traps, which indicates suitable microhabitats for development across the entire area of the stand. Only the species Ampedus nigrinus was presented by one individual. Neither species is on the Czech Red List (Hejda et al. 2017), nor protected by the czech law. Not a single Click beetle was caught in trap number 11.

### MOLLUSCS

Methods of malacological research
Žofínský Forest, research area 15
 
Coordinates: 48.6685294N, 14.7068778E
 
The malacological survey was carried out in a circular research area with a diameter of 25 meters. Leaf litter was sampled in the research area. The leaf litter was collected from small sub-plots distributed within the research area to cover all microhabitats suitable for molluscs, thus capturing the overall habitat diversity of the area. The total sample volume collected from the study area was 5 litres. 
Additionally, a manual sampling of molluscs was carried out in the research area. Molluscs were collected on the soil surface, under stones, at the base of trees, under overlying bark, in moist places and other suitable habitats for molluscs. The manual sampling was carried out for 15 minutes by one person.
Subsequently, a manual sampling targeting dendrophilous mollusc species was carried out in the site. Five lying trunks were selected that were no more than 50 m from the center of the research area. On these trees, hand collection of molluscs was carried out from the trunk surface and from gaps under the bark. Each trunk was sampled for a period of 15 minutes.
Molluscs collected by both types of manual sampling were either determined in situ and returned to the site or, if determination in the field was not possible, were taken for later determination. 
The leaf litter samples obtained were thoroughly dried at room temperature. Mollusc shells were then separated from the sample and determined 
The system and nomenclature used is according to the actual Check-list of the molluscs of the Czech and Slovak Republics Horsák et al. (2025).  <br>
